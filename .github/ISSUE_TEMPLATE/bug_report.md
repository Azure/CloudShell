## Is this specific to Cloud Shell?
Please verify if the same issue can be reproduced by running the same tool **outside Cloud Shell** - for example,
by installing it on your own computer. If so, it is likely to be a bug in that tool or in the Azure service it communicates with, 
not in Cloud Shell. Please file the issue with the appropriate project.

## Interface information
How are you accessing Cloud Shell - https://shell.azure.com, https://portal.azure.com, via Windows Terminal, or some other method?
If a browser, which Operating System and browser are you using? (ex. Edge on Windows 10)
